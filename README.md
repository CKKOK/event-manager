# Ideas
1. ~~Trip destination / itinerary one-stop recommendations and planner. Similar to tripadvisor?~~
 * ~~How to differentiate from Tripadvisor?~~
 * ~~Adding air ticket price prediction service. How will users react to this? Will they take it up?~~
 * ~~Planning / monitoring of trip in greater detail via timelines. Good value for user, e.g. takes a lot of mental stress away from vacations. But how will notifications be done?~~
2. ~~Events management app~~ *Scale might be too large for a 1 week project*
 * ~~What are all the different endpoints to the app?~~
 * ~~How does the ERD look like? Will it be too massive?~~
3. Spinoff of events management app: eWedding planning / events registration app with QR code scanning capabilities
4. ~~Equipment / venue rental service, combined with geolocation data and B2C communication~~ 
5. ~~Price and stock collation of IT equipment, i.e. advertising platform for IT vendors.~~ *As another advertising platform, the value proposition to both vendors and customers is still unclear.*
 * ~~User stories from the vendors and buyers? What problem does this solve for both parties? Note: Some shops do advertise their stuff on Carousell, so why aren't the rest doing it? Need to understand the problems they face first.~~
6. ~~Elder companion / monitoring / chat app~~
7. ~~User submitted video app (YouTube)~~
8. ~~Coding game app~~
9. ~~E-commerce site~~
