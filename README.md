# Project 3 (Need a name)

# Ideas
1. Trip destination / itinerary one-stop recommendations and planner. Similar to tripadvisor?
 * How to differentiate from Tripadvisor?
 * Adding air ticket price prediction service. How will users react to this? Will they take it up?
 * Planning / monitoring of trip in greater detail via timelines. Good value for user, e.g. takes a lot of mental stress away from vacations. But how will notifications be done?
2. Events management app
 * What are all the different endpoints to the app?
 * How does the ERD look like? Will it be too massive?
3. Spinoff of events management app: eWedding planning / events registration app with QR code scanning capabilities
4. Equipment / venue rental service, combined with geolocation data and B2C communication
5. Price and stock collation of IT equipment, i.e. advertising platform for IT vendors.
 * User stories from the vendors and buyers? What problem does this solve for both parties? Note: Some shops do advertise their stuff on Carousell, so why aren't the rest doing it? Need to understand the problems they face first.
 
# Tasks
1. Front end
  * Design, i.e. moodboard
  * Standard new / edit / index / show views
  * SCSS
2. Back end
  * CRUD functionality
