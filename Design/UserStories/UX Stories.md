Our service can address the above needs with the following functions...

    * Guest registration and (graphical) table allocation
    * (Good-to-have) Ruby QR Code Generator: https://github.com/whomwah/rqrcode and HTML5/JS QR Code Reader: https://github.com/schmich/instascan 
2. For each role, a timeline panel and an update / next-action-to-take panel. Couple / another admin can have an overview.
3. Photography Component: Couple, photographer, guest, wedding planner (assigned by the couple)
    * Photo uploads by photographer and guest. Admins can delete all. Guests can delete their own photo.
